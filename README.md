# Vaishnava
# Problem Statement
To design an umbrella app which is engaging and serves as reader for Nityanusandhanam and ready functionality of other components of the daily activities of a devotee.

# Description
We attempt to design an app which tries to bridge the gap in resources to learn the Stotras and Divya Prabandham, process of Bhagavad Aradhana, and a platform to procure resources and a community to discuss the same which form an integral component in the day of a Vaishnava.

## Some features are:
*	Original text and Translation of Stotras and Divya Prabandham in multiple scripts i.e. both Transliteration and Translation.
*	Basic information about the authors, i.e. the Azhwars.
*	Navigability from the list of verses to individual verses in a new Page.
## Future Enhancements
*	**Hari Store**: Essentials for Bhagavad Aradhana and a manual for the same.
*	**Hari Katha**: Group chat utility

# Novelty
Though this has been addressed in the past by prapatti.org, srivaishnavan.org and the publications of Ubhaya Vedanta Pravarthana Sabha, etc. the applications are distributed and are not in one place. These are addressed and we arrive at
* Language friendliness
*	Graded and beginner-friendliness
*	Resource + Manual + Community at one place
